# PhotovoltaicUI

A Package containing User Interface Elements for visualizing the energy and power flow
in a typical household, having photovoltaic power generation installed.

## Introduction
This package was developped initially as SenecUI to support a photovoltaic setup managed by
a Senec battery system. After the release of SwiftUI and the possibility to add resources to
Swift Packages (starting with Swift 5.3) the code was nearly completely rewritte and has now no
relation neither to UIKit nor to AppKit or other platform-specific frameworks.

Additionally the framework was renamed as it may be used for any photovoltaic system, not
only for Senec systems.
